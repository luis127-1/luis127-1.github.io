  <h2>Estadio Do Morumbi</h2>
                <p>In the early years of its existence, São Paulo Futebol Clube used for their headquarters and home field the Chácara da Floresta, located beside the Ponte das Bandeiras next to the Tietê river in the center of São Paulo. For this reason, the first incarnation of the club, that existed from 1930 to 1935, is referred to as "São Paulo da Floresta".

                  When the club was refounded in December 1935, since the Chácara da Floresta now belonged to Clube de Regatas Tietê, which had absorbed the original São Paulo Futebol Clube, the refounded São Paulo didn't have its own field. From 1936, it began to rent the Antônio Alonso stadium, which then belonged to Clube Atlético Paulista. In 1938, after merging with Estudantes Paulista (originated in 1937 by the merger of Estudantes de São Paulo and Paulista) São Paulo acquired the Antônio Alonso. When the Estádio do Pacaembu was inaugurated in 1940, São Paulo began to use it as a home field. the Antônio Alonso stadium was sold to Juventus in 1942.
                  
                  In 1944, São Paulo bought a piece of ground called Canindé, which was only used as a headquarters and training location. The area was too small for the construction of a large stadium, so studies were done to find another home within the city of São Paulo.
                  
                  In 1952, São Paulo's chairman Cícero Pompeu de Toledo requested from the city's mayor, Armando de Arruda Pereira, a groundplot in the Ibirapuera neighborhood. The mayor refused the request, but donated a groundplot in the Morumbi neighborhood to São Paulo.
                  On 15 August 1952, the stadium construction started. Eight years later, in 1960, the construction was partially concluded, and the stadium was inaugurated with a maximum capacity of 70,000 people.

                  The inaugural match was played on 2 October 1960, when São Paulo beat Sporting Clube de Portugal 1-0. The first goal in the stadium was scored by São Paulo's Peixinho.
                  
                  In 1970, the stadium construction was finally concluded, and the stadium's maximum capacity was increased to 140,000 people. The re-inaugural match between São Paulo and Porto drew 1-1.</p>

<h2>Record Attendance</h2>
                  <p>The largest audience for a football match was on November 16, 1980, when São Paulo beat Santos 1-0, in the first match valid for the finals of the Campeonato Paulista. On this occasion, the unofficially registered audience was 156,000 people, while the registered audience was 122,535 spectators. Jornal da Tarde estimated the total audience to be much higher than what was officially recorded: "Yesterday's audience will never be known for sure [...]. The number of 122 thousand people, officially announced by the collectors, is smaller than the reality. Many people entered without paying for tickets, amidst the commotion on the access ramps to the numbered stands and stands. Other fans didn't even hand in their tickets at the turnstile. Journalist Alberto Helena Júnior, from the same newspaper, recalled that the shipment of 156 thousand tickets had been completely sold: "One hundred and twenty-two thousand people, how, if all the tickets were sold and the gates were closed half an hour before the start of the match?"</p>
