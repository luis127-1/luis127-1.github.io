<h2>2021–present</h2>
<p>Champions of All In 2021, São Paulo finally ended its second biggest dry spell in its history (8 years); under new manager Hernán Crespo, the club defeated Palmeiras at the Campeonato Paulista finals, winning the competition for the first time since 2005. However, after a continuing sequence of poor results, which included quarter-final exits in the Copa Libertadores and in the Copa do Brasil to Palmeiras and Fortaleza, respectively, Crespo was sacked in October, with the club being involved in another relegation battle at the Campeonato Brasileiro, eventually finishing 13th, after Crespo was replaced by club legend Rogério Ceni in his second managerial spell.  In 2022, under Ceni, the club reached once again the Campeonato Paulista finals, reaching their third state finals in four years; a progress, since São Paulo didn't reach the state finals between 2007 (when the knock-out second phase was re-established) and 2018. São Paulo ended the competition as runners-up to Palmeiras; despite winning the first leg 3–1 at the Morumbi, they suffered a heavy 4–0 comeback defeat at Allianz Parque. Also in 2022, the club reached the semifinals of the 2022 Copa do Brasil, being eliminated by eventual winners Flamengo, and suffered another final defeat, this time in the Copa Sudamericana, losing to Ecuadorian side Independiente del Valle in Córdoba, Argentina. It was the first time since 2005 the club reached two finals in the same year. In the Campeonato Brasileiro, however, São Paulo finished in 9th place, one position outside Copa Libertadores qualification.  In 2023, just like six years before, Rogério Ceni was sacked and replaced by Dorival Júnior after getting eliminated in the quarter-final of the Campeonato Paulista to underdogs and eventual runners-up Água Santa. Under the guidance of Dorival, São Paulo won its first Copa do Brasil title in a memorable run, defeating along the way Ituano, Sport Recife and, most notably, city rivals Palmeiras and Corinthians and defending champions Flamengo in the finals, winning the first leg 1–0 in the Maracanã and drawing 1–1 at the second leg in the Morumbi.[35] The club finished 11th in the Campeonato Brasileiro and reached the quarter-finals of the Copa Sudamericana, being eliminated by eventual champions L.D.U. Quito.  After a successful year, Dorival Júnior left São Paulo in January 2024 to manage the Brazil national team; it was the third time the club lost their manager to a national team in more than eight years (the others being Juan Carlos Osorio to Mexico in 2015 and in the following year, Edgardo Bauza to Argentina).[36] Juventude manager Thiago Carpini was appointed as Dorival's replacement,[37] guiding the club to the 2024 Supercopa Rei defeating Palmeiras on penalties at the Mineirão in Belo Horizonte.</p></p>
